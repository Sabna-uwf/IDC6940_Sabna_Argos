## Introduction

The aim of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of few DL techniques, like Res-Net and Dense Net. As a result of exploring the capabilities of these two neural networks, we are aiming to determine their effectiveness and suitability for classifying the knee pathologies. Deep Learning (DL) architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are a flexible class of computational models that combine the strengths of hierarchical feature extraction and automated pattern recognition (LeCun et al. 2015). Like traditional image processing, CNNs can model complex visual data, such as medical radiographs and scans. However, modern architectures like DenseNet (Densely Connected Networks) and ResNet (Residual Networks) extend standard CNNs by incorporating advanced connectivity patterns such as skip connections and feature concatenation which account for the vanishing gradient problem and the need for efficient feature reuse. Wang et al. (2024) noted that manual diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears often struggles with inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load placed on radiologists. This ambiguity makes it difficult to provide consistent, rapid outcomes for patients. CNNs address this by modeling local spatial dependencies, incorporating multi-scale feature maps, and capturing the high-dimensional variability between different knee pathologies. The specialized layers in ResNet and DenseNet help model the complex relationships within image patches and allow for the detection of "unobserved" patterns anatomical nuances that are not captured by traditional linear measurements.
Similarly, Awan et al. (2021) utilize a deep learning approach to investigate the efficient detection of knee ACL injuries from MRI data. In their analysis, they demonstrate how optimized CNN architectures account for variation in regional joint data, proving that deep learning provides both the flexibility and tractability required for reliable medical classification.
This study investigates the potential for automated diagnostics in sports medicine, with a particular focus on the accurate classification of ACL injuries. To analyze these risks, we will apply a DenseNet-based 3D model, a robust computational method suited for complex, hierarchical medical volumes. Our goal is to examine the relationship between the visual features of the knee joint specifically within the Region of Interest (ROI) and the three-way classification of ACL health: normal, partial tear, and complete rupture.


## Methods

-   Detail the models or algorithms used.

-   Justify your choices based on the problem and data.

*The common non-parametric regression model is*
$Y_i = m(X_i) + \varepsilon_i$*, where* $Y_i$ *can be defined as the sum
of the regression function value* $m(x)$ *for* $X_i$*. Here* $m(x)$ *is
unknown and* $\varepsilon_i$ *some errors. With the help of this
definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e.*
$m(x)$ *can be estimated with the product of* $Y_i$ *average and* $X_i$
*is near to* $x$*. In other words, this means that we are discovering
the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data
points. The estimation formula is printed below [@R-base]:*

$$
M_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \tag{1}
$$$W_n(x)$ *is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers.
Weights are positive numbers and small if* $X_i$ *is far from* $x$*.*

*Another equation:*

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 +\varepsilon_i
$$
