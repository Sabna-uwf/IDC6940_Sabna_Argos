## Introduction

## we are still in the planning phase:

#1. Whether to do comparitive analysis using just 2 cnn architectures or include more.

#2. To analysis various knee pathologies like :ACL tear, knee ostheritstics, meniscus tears or just to analysis the acl tear.


The aim of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of few DL techniques, like Res-Net and Dense Net. As a result of exploring the capabilities of these two neural networks, we are aiming to determine their effectiveness and suitability for classifying the knee pathologies. Deep Learning (DL) architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are a flexible class of computational models that combine the strengths of hierarchical feature extraction and automated pattern recognition (LeCun et al. 2015). Like traditional image processing, CNNs can model complex visual data, such as medical radiographs and scans. However, modern architectures like DenseNet (Densely Connected Networks) and ResNet (Residual Networks) extend standard CNNs by incorporating advanced connectivity patterns such as skip connections and feature concatenation which account for the vanishing gradient problem and the need for efficient feature reuse.[@wang2024deep] noted that manual diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears often struggles with inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load placed on radiologists. This made it difficult to provide consistent, rapid outcomes for patients. But the specialized layers in ResNet and DenseNet help model the complex relationships within image patches and allow for the detection of patterns that are not captured by traditional linear measurements.
Similarly,  [@javed2021efficient] utilize a deep learning approach to investigate the efficient detection of knee ACL injuries from MRI data. In their analysis, they demonstrate how optimized CNN architectures account for variation in regional joint data, proving that deep learning provides both the flexibility and tractability required for reliable medical classification.
This study investigates the potential for diagnosis of knee pathologies particularly focusing on the accurate classification of ACL injuries. To analyze these risks, we will apply  different cnn models which can be used for complex data.  


## Methods

-   Detail the models or algorithms used.

-   Justify your choices based on the problem and data.

*The common non-parametric regression model is*
$Y_i = m(X_i) + \varepsilon_i$*, where* $Y_i$ *can be defined as the sum
of the regression function value* $m(x)$ *for* $X_i$*. Here* $m(x)$ *is
unknown and* $\varepsilon_i$ *some errors. With the help of this
definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e.*
$m(x)$ *can be estimated with the product of* $Y_i$ *average and* $X_i$
*is near to* $x$*. In other words, this means that we are discovering
the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data
points. The estimation formula is printed below [@R-base]:*

$$
M_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \tag{1}
$$$W_n(x)$ *is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers.
Weights are positive numbers and small if* $X_i$ *is far from* $x$*.*

*Another equation:*

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 +\varepsilon_i
$$

## Analysis and Results

### Data Exploration and Visualization

-   Describe your data sources and collection process.

-   Present initial findings and insights through visualizations.

-   Highlight unexpected patterns or anomalies.



### Modeling and Results
Dataset Description – MRNet v1.0

For automated knee MRI diagnosis, we use the MRNet v1.0 dataset released by the Stanford Machine Learning Group**. The dataset contains knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations collected at Stanford University Medical Center. It was introduced to support research in deep learning–based detection of common knee injuries.

The dataset consists of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed on different patients. Each exam includes multiple MRI slices captured in three anatomical planes: axial, coronal, and sagittal. For every exam, labels are provided for three diagnostic tasks:

Abnormality detection

ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) tear detection

Meniscal tear detection

The labels were extracted from radiology reports and reviewed for research purposes. The dataset is widely used as a benchmark for medical image classification and multi-label learning tasks.

The dataset is typically split into:
Training set: 1,130 exams

Validation set: 120 exams

Test set: 120 exams (held-out for evaluation in the original competition)

Data Definition

Unlike transactional datasets, MRNet is an exam-level medical imaging dataset. The data is organized as image volumes rather than tabular transaction records.

Attribute	Type	Description
Study ID	Nominal	Unique identifier assigned to each MRI exam
Plane	Nominal	MRI acquisition plane (Axial, Coronal, Sagittal)
Image Slices	Image Sequence	Stack of 2D grayscale MRI slices forming a 3D volume
Abnormal	Binary (0/1)	Indicates presence of any abnormality
ACL Tear	Binary (0/1)	Indicates presence of ACL tear
Meniscal Tear	Binary (0/1)	Indicates presence of meniscal tear

Each study contains:

Variable number of slices (typically 20–60 per plane)

Grayscale images

Stored in .npy format (NumPy arrays)


### Conclusion
