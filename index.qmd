## Introduction



The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, especially those involving the knee, including osteoarthritis (OA), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and meniscal injuries, is a major global healthcare concern that has a profound effect on the mobility and quality of life of affected patients. Conventional diagnostic tools, especially X-ray radiography, have several limitations, including the inability to image soft tissues, often resulting in the missed diagnosis of early degenerative changes until late-stage damage has been incurred (Panwar et al. 2025). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has recently become the standard diagnostic tool for musculoskeletal imaging because of its high contrast resolution and multi-planar imaging capabilities, which enable the detailed evaluation of ligaments, cartilage, and bone marrow (Qiu et al. 2021). However, the current manual analysis of knee MRI scans is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially with regard to inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load of radiologists, which can result in delays in diagnosis and treatment (Bien et al. 2018).

Conventional MRI assessment of the knee relies on manual segmentation of anatomical structures, which is time-consuming and prone to variability. Zhou et al. (2018) demonstrated that a deep convolutional neural network can automatically segment knee joint tissues, including cartilage and meniscus, providing accurate and consistent delineation to support more efficient analysis of knee anatomy and pathology (Zhou et al. 2018)

The synergy of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), provides a revolutionary approach to overcome these diagnostic hurdles by enabling an automated, objective, and scalable analysis of complex medical images (Oettl et al. 2025). CNNs are especially suited for medical imaging applications because they have the capability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw pixel data, including subtle pathological patterns that may not be visible to the human eye (Yeoh et al. 2021). Recent breakthroughs have shown the effectiveness of both 2D and 3D CNN models for segmenting musculoskeletal tissues and grading the severity of structural damage (Liu et al. 2018; Guida, Zhang, and Shan 2021). However, there are still major challenges to overcome in the current state of research, such as the requirement for large and high-quality annotated datasets and the lack of generalizability of models across different MRI protocols and hardware configurations (Goel 2025).

To overcome these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient automated systems that are capable of multi-pathology detection and grading to help doctors in high-throughput settings (Astuto et al. 2021). Although specialized models have proved to be successful in specific tasks like the detection of ACL tears using self-supervised learning techniques (Aidarkhan et al. 2025) or staging meniscus degeneration (Pedoia et al. 2019), the development of a comprehensive framework that can distinguish between different simultaneous knee injuries is still an intricate challenge. Using the latest advancements in CNN models, this research aims to develop an automated system for the detection and grading of knee pathologies from MRI images, which can eventually help in providing better patient care strategies for early intervention (Awan et al. 2021).

Manual assessment of knee osteoarthritis severity is often time-consuming and subjective. A recent study demonstrated that a CNN-based deep learning model can automatically detect and grade knee osteoarthritis from imaging data, providing accurate and consistent classification that can support faster and more reliable diagnosis.(Rani et al. 2024)

This research work is driven by the need to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis in orthopedic radiology.





### Data Exploration and Visualization

Dataset Description – MRNet v1.0

For automated knee MRI diagnosis, we use the MRNet v1.0 dataset released by the Stanford Machine Learning Group**. The dataset contains knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations collected at Stanford University Medical Center. It was introduced to support research in deep learning–based detection of common knee injuries.

The dataset consists of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed on different patients. Each exam includes multiple MRI slices captured in three anatomical planes: axial, coronal, and sagittal. For every exam, labels are provided for three diagnostic tasks:

Abnormality detection

ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) tear detection

Meniscal tear detection

The labels were extracted from radiology reports and reviewed for research purposes. The dataset is widely used as a benchmark for medical image classification and multi-label learning tasks.

The dataset is typically split into:
Training set: 1,130 exams

Validation set: 120 exams

Test set: 120 exams (held-out for evaluation in the original competition)

Data Definition

Unlike transactional datasets, MRNet is an exam-level medical imaging dataset. The data is organized as image volumes rather than tabular transaction records.

Attribute	Type	Description
Study ID	Nominal	Unique identifier assigned to each MRI exam
Plane	Nominal	MRI acquisition plane (Axial, Coronal, Sagittal)
Image Slices	Image Sequence	Stack of 2D grayscale MRI slices forming a 3D volume
Abnormal	Binary (0/1)	Indicates presence of any abnormality
ACL Tear	Binary (0/1)	Indicates presence of ACL tear
Meniscal Tear	Binary (0/1)	Indicates presence of meniscal tear

Each study contains:

Variable number of slices (typically 20–60 per plane)

Grayscale images

Stored in .npy format (NumPy arrays)
